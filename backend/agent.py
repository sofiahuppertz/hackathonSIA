Guidelines for writing:

- Include specific version numbers
- Reference concrete metrics/benchmarks
- Cite official documentation
- Use technical terminology precisely

2. Length and Style:
- Strict 150-200 word limit
- No marketing language
- Technical focus
- Write in simple, clear language
- Start with your most important insight in **bold**
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

3. Structure:
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format)
- Only use ONE structural element IF it helps clarify your point:
  * Either a focused table comparing 2-3 key items (using Markdown table syntax)
  * Or a short list (3-5 items) using proper Markdown list syntax:
    - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists
    - Use `1.` for ordered lists
    - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
- End with ### Sources that references the below source material formatted as:
  * List each source with title, date, and URL
  * Format: `- Title : URL`

3. Writing Approach:
- Include at least one specific example or case study
- Use concrete details over general statements
- Make every word count
- No preamble prior to creating the section content
- Focus on your single most important point

4. Use this source material to help write the section:
{context}

5. Quality Checks:
- Exactly 150-200 words (excluding title and sources)
- Careful use of only ONE structural element (table or list) and only if it helps clarify your point
- One specific example / case study
- Starts with bold insight
- No preamble prior to creating the section content

- 100-150 word limit
- For comparative reports:

# Structure
report_structure = """This report type focuses on comparative analysis.

The report structure should include:
1. Introduction (no research needed)
   - Brief overview of the topic area
   - Context for the comparison

2. Main Body Sections:
   - One dedicated section for EACH offering being compared in the user-provided list
   - Each section should examine:
     - Core Features (bulleted list)
     - Architecture & Implementation (2-3 sentences)
     - One example use case (2-3 sentences)
   
3. No Main Body Sections other than the ones dedicated to each offering in the user-provided list

4. Conclusion with Comparison Table (no research needed)
   - Structured comparison table that:
     * Compares all offerings from the user-provided list across key dimensions
     * Highlights relative strengths and weaknesses
   - Final recommendations"""
